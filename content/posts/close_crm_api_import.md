I recently was tasked to write a custom python script importing some given `.csv` file into [Close.com](https://www.close.com) via their API. It was the first time I had to use their API, so there was a lot of trial and error involved. Additionally the input data had to be serverly cleaned up to be compatible with the API requirements.
Apart from the mere import the script also should create a little report based on the same input data.

The full solution including setup, sample input file can be found at: [derwaro/CloseAPItask](https://github.com/derwaro/CloseAPItask)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3.8
import babel.numbers
import csv
from closeio_api import Client
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.parser import parse as parse_date
from decimal import Decimal
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError
from statistics import median
import os

# load the .env file containing your api key and custom field ids
load_dotenv()

# set locale so that numbers are correctly formated in the report
currency = os.getenv("BABEL_CURRENCY") or "USD"
locale = os.getenv("BABEL_LOCALE") or "en_US"


# vars for close api. enter your key and ids in ""
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
custom_company_founded_api_id = "custom." + os.getenv("CUSTOM_COMPANY_FOUNDED_API_ID")
custom_company_revenue_api_id = "custom." + os.getenv("CUSTOM_COMPANY_REVENUE_API_ID")
