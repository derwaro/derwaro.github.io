In this post I will shortly describe my current terminal setup.
I'm currently (and have been for a long time) using LinuxMint 20.3 Una using the Cinnamon DE. I'm quite happy with it, but still strive to use the terminal more and more, since it is *the* tool of tools. There obviously still is a lot to learn, but here I go.

## reverse-search
One of my favorite if not my favorite *tool* is `ctrl + r`!
I still remember manually typing each command or (for better of worse) manually searching commands with the up-arrow.
While the simple command already is of great help, there is obviously room for expansion, since it presents only one result and continuing the search calls for multiple `ctrl + r` calls.
## reverse-search + Atuin
That's were [Atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin) steps in! It features multiple results in one search and even hotkeys to call the quickly without using the arrow keys. Furthermore it shows, when the command was last called and if it was called successfully or not.
