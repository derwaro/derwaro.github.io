Although I mostly use the genius [EurKey](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/) Keyboard Layout on my laptop, I frequently switch between layouts, when typing in German for longer texts. Furthermore my wife prefers the Spanish/Latin American Layout. That's why I frequently have to switch between those three keyboard layouts. Fortunately it's quite easy to do on my laptop. By pressing `CTRL + Super` I toggle through my selected layouts and receive feedback by a little country flag (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹) or by a short letter code (`lat` or `eur`).

Lately I used my wifes iPad for writing stuff and found myself in the trouble of having to long press `S` to be able to write the German letter `ÃŸ`. However sometimes the letter was right there in the first layer. Other times it wasn't there, but the Spanish `Ã‘` was in the first layer of the layout. I couldn't quite make out a pattern. I knew that in the setting for the virtual keyboard layout English, German and Spanish were set. However I never had found out how to actually change the layout at will.

Since I normally only used it for passive consuming I never had the urge to find out. Until now. So I set out for searching the Internet for a solution, but never found a satisfying solution. To make things short, I recorded this little video to showcase how to switch between the set layout: press and hold the little world symbol on the virtual keyboard and then slide up to select the desired/needed layout.

*Edit: I since found the right page on [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/add-or-change-keyboards-ipad1aa5a19a/ipados). Searching stuff really became a hit and miss thing.
