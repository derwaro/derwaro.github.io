# Background or How I Got To Where I Got

In 2017 I changed from a head on, face-to-face position to a more administrative, back-office-y position. My supervisors proposed me to change into a coordinator position for a team of in-house interpreters. I quickly accepted since it sounded like a challenging position and furthermore after years of directly working on a day to day basis with persons in difficult, uncertain situations it relieved me of growing pessimism (or even second hand trauma).

The team of interpreters was split into two teams, each roughly making up half of the workload. One team was made up of the Arabic and Somali, the other of Farsi, Afghani Languages (Dari, Pashtu, Urdu,...) and Russian. I was assigned to the later team and instructed by my predecessor. During this introduction I already sensed some pain points in the day to day workflows and also recurring tasks (especially the monthly billing). Since I just started out I first of all tried to grasp the whole picture to be able to think and plan improvements and measures.

# Initial Situation

Working as an interpreter is a classic self-dependent work in Austria, one works independently for different clients. Still, since my employer worked with migrants coming to Austria there was a fixed need for a certain amount of interpreters at most of the times. They decided to offer some, later all, interpreters a position in a newly created team. The idea was that this teams not only covers the need for interpretation in-house, but also for other sites/offices within the same company and furthermore for external clients. The need in-house would see coverage for most of the languages during office hours (interpreters on call, in person). External clients (both within the same company and from other companies) would be covered through reservation on a per booking basis (with fixed hourly rates).  
For me as a coordinator this meant to organize my team in a way that enough interpreters are available for colleagues in-house and to organize external appointments in such a manner that the most of them could be covered by our interpreters.

## In-House Organization

The planning was (and more or less still is) done on a weekly basis. When I started out the weekly plan was done in an Excel Sheet. The Sheet resided in an `.xls` file, which contained one sheet for each week of the year. In the file we manually copied, that is added, the next week manually and then on the basis of the current week worked out the plan for the next week. That meant we had to check who was missing in the current week due to illness or vacation and who had differing working hours in the current week. Since we deleted rows for those who were missing, we manually had to readd those rows and again enter the working hours for that person.
