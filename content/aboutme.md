# Servus, Hola, Hello
My name is Christian. I'm a studied cultural and social anthropologist.
Since my studies I worked helping migrants in Austria.
In my free time I work on my homenetwork and reading up on new technological developments in informational technologies. Lately I started programming in Python, focusing on Flask and catching up on Django and FastAPI. Currently I'm in the process of creating an open source booking tool, which is already in used in my workplace, but needs some adaptions to be usably outside of this specific workflow.

Feel free to contact me!
