# Servus, Hola, Hello
My name is Christian. I'm a studied cultural and social anthropologist turned social worker, coordinator and programmer.
Since my studies I worked helping migrants in Austria.
In my free time I work on my homenetwork and reading up on new technological developments in informational technologies or novels. My favorites are science fiction or beat-style stories. Lately I started programming in Python, focusing on Flask and catching up on Django and FastAPI. Currently I'm in the process of creating an open source booking tool, which is already in used in my workplace, but needs some adaptions to be usably outside of this specific workflow.

On these pages I will post mostly in English (I seek to improve my writing in English), German or Spanish. The content is divided between *posts* and *blog*, where the former is technical stuff and the later more personal content (and features more posts that are not in English).

See my work on [github](https://www.github.com/derwaro) or contact me on [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@derwaro).
