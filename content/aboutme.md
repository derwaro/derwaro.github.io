# Servus, Hola, Hello
My name is derwaro. I'm a studied cultural and social anthropologist turned programmer.
In my free time I work on my home network and reading up on new technological developments in informational technologies or novels. I have been using Linux since compiz and 3D-cube-rotating-desktops-windows-melting-away-on-minimize were *the thing*. I started out with some version of OpenSuSe and then hopped distro a thousand times as one should and run LinuxMint happily since some years now. However I gave in and got myself a Mac recently. My favorites literature genres are science fiction or beat-style stories. I mostly program in Python, focusing on Flask, Django and FastAPI, but dable in Frontend-matters too. Currently I'm in the process of creating an open source booking tool and a marketing tool aimed to improve event attendance through personalized, programmed phone calls.  

On these pages I will post mostly in English (I seek to improve my writing in English), German or Spanish. Posts are divided into bigger [categories](/categories) (tech, personal, ...) and [tagged](/tags) according to their content. 

See my work in my [showcase on this site](/categories/showcase) or on [github](https://www.github.com/derwaro). Feel free to contact me on [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@derwaro).
