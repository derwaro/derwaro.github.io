      <description>Servus, Hola, Hello My name is Christian Hrdina. I&amp;rsquo;m a studied cultural and social anthropologist. Since my studies I worked helping migrants in Austria. In my free time I work on my homenetwork and reading up on new technological developments in informational technologies. Lately I started programming in Python, focusing on Flask. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of creating an open source booking tool, which is already in used in my workplace, but needs some adaptions to be usably outside of this specific workflow.</description>
